# TShell
##By Alex Bahm & Cameron Mehl

# ATTENTION THIS IS NOT SECURE. DO NOT RUN THIS ON YOUR PERSONAL MACHINE, SOMEONE CAN EASILY DELETE ALL YOUR FILES

####Description
  Using the Twilio API, we interpret the content of the text message as a shell command, execute it, and text back the response.
  There are a few special cases
  * `Hackathon`: Sends a picture of our hackathon Sticker
  * `Go Cougs!`: Sends a picture of the WSU logo
  * `LShark`: Sends a picture of "Left Shark" as made famous by the Super Bowl 49 Halftime show
  * Hazardous commands: There are some commands we identified as dangerous. When those commands are sent to the server, we catch them, and respond with "Left Shark"
  
  ###Goals of the project:
  * Have fun
  * Learn Go
  * Not take the entire time
    * One of us was an organizer of the Hackathon, and had to work part time making sure things went smoothly
    * We were exhausted going into the Hackathon, and thus knew we wouldn't be able to work at our full ability for the full time. 
  
  ### MISC Notes
  * Sorry for all the Left Shark, we are exhausted seniors and thought it was silly.
